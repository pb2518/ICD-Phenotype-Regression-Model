# Step 3: ICD Phenotype File and Format - Script Outline

The raw phenotype data file (.csv) was acquired and read in from UKBB comprising of a single data frame containing 378 grouped phenotype column variables for 502,536 individuals. A .html file was provided, briefly outlining what each column represents. However, various QC measures were taken by applying an automatic filter to remove any interfering background population by ethnicity and for this analysis only the first 314 grouped diagnostic phenotype column variables were used for 410,336 individuals, which are encoded by Data-coding 19 UKBB format (a hierarchical tree-structured dictionary which uses strings (character sequences) to represent categories or special values similar to ICD-10-CM).  Those columns were first selected from the raw data file. Then to ensure all the  data-coding 19 codes matched to the correct ICD-10-CM code, a UKBB data-coding 19 file (.tsv) was inputted, and a loop was created to translate any non-matching codes into the correct ICD-10-CM code and format. This was then outputted into a table including the corresponding phenotype data.
